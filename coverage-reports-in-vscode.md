# Create and view coverage reports in VSCode

Testing code is a staple of most environments where reliability and predictability are highly valued, however, while tests alone will help ensure that that classes and functions are behaving as expected, they do not give a holistic view of of which parts of the codebase are being tested or not. Code coverage helps bridge this gap by generating a report based on the tests that have been run and which parts of the codebase were run during the testing phase, down to the exact lines of code that were run.

To properly showcase the value of using code coverage for your projects, this guide will walk you through setting up and viewing code coverage reports in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for a project that already has test suites set up. You will learn how to view code coverage in your editor as well as set up continuous monitoring of coverage metrics.

We will use the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework [repository](https://github.com/django/django) as an example, which already has tests suites and the ability to generate coverage reports and show you how to add functionality to these code coverage tools by using a few more resources.

## Coverage Gutters, CodeCov, and Coverage

### Coverage (Python Library)

`Coverage.py` is a Python library for measuring code coverage. This library provides insights into which parts of your code are being executed during tests and which parts aren't. It supports multiple report formats like terminal output, `HTML`, `XML`, and `JSON` for analysis.

This is the library which we will use to generate the coverage report which both Coverage Gutters and Codecov will use to display coverage information later in the tutorial.

### Coverage Gutters

To gain visibility of code coverage during development with VSCode, there is an extension called `Coverage Gutters` that highlights which lines of code are/not covered by tests by highlighting the "gutters" of a file that is open.

This visual aid helps you quickly assess the areas of your code that need more test coverage without leaving your development environment.

### Codecov

Codecov further extends the usefulness of coverage reports by providing a way to upload the coverage reports to a central dashboard, allowing you to track your projectâ€™s coverage over time and share this information as widely as required.

The Codecov CLI allows you to manually upload coverage reports for evaluation without having to make any changes to a project.

## Installing Coverage.py for coverage reports in Python

### Clone Repository

Start by forking the Django web framework [repository](https://github.com/django/django).

In a terminal, clone the forked Django repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YourGitHubName>/django.git django-repo
```

Navigate into the newly cloned repository:

```bash
cd django-repo
```

### Install Packages

Create a new virtual environment to isolate the packages for this project from your global packages with:

```bash
python -m venv ~/venvs/django
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source ~/venvs/django/bin/activate
```

Install the packages from `package.json` with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Install Test Dependencies

Install the packages the tests require to run:

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt
```

### Install Coverage

Additionally, install the `coverage` package, which will generate the coverage reports:

```bash
pip install coverage
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

Run the tests using coverage:

```bash
coverage run ./tests/runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite
```

This command uses `Coverage.py` to run the script that the Django repo uses to kick off the test runs with a test database specified by the `--settings=test_sqlite` flag.

You will notice the tests being run in your terminal, once they are complete, a new file will have appeared in the root directory of the repository: `.coverge`. This file contains the coverage information gathered during the test runs. However, in this form the data is not very useful.

### Generate Coverage Report

Generate a coverage report in `XML` format by running:

```bash
coverage xml
```

You will now see another new file that was created: `coverage.xml`. This is the file that contains a formatted view of all the information that `coverage` gathered while the tests were run.

If all you want is the total coverage of the project, you can open the generated `XML` file and find the `line-rate` attribute in the `coverage` tag:

```xml
<coverage version="7.6.1" timestamp="1729075463150" lines-valid="196017" lines-covered="64098" line-rate="0.327" branches-covered="0" branches-valid="0" branch-rate="0" complexity="0">
```

The values for `line-rate` in this file have been normalized, to translate this into a percentage, simple multiply the value by 100:

```
0.327 * 100 = 32.7%
```

To better understand what the report contains, continue with the below or skip to the [Coverage Gutters Extension for VSCode](#coverage-gutters-extension-for-vscode) section to use the report to display coverage information in your VSCode editor.

### Understanding the Coverage Report

The `coverage.xml` file provides comprehensive details about code coverage, including general metrics such as the version of the coverage tool, the timestamp of report generation, and overall line and branch coverage rates.  
It lists the source directories and provides detailed coverage metrics for each package, class, and file, including line and branch rates, complexity, and the number of hits per line.  

This structured information helps identify which parts of the code are covered by tests and highlights areas needing more testing. It is also the file that VSCode extensions such as Coverage Gutters will use to display the lines hit/missed and percent coverage for an open file.

If you view the content of `coverage.xml` you will see a report that looks something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<coverage version="7.6.1" timestamp="1727936331112" lines-valid="196017" lines-covered="64094" line-rate="0.327" branches-covered="0" branches-valid="0" branch-rate="0" complexity="0">
 <!-- Generated by coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.6.1 -->
 <!-- Based on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cobertura/web/master/htdocs/xml/coverage-04.dtd -->
 <sources>
  <source>/path/to/django</source>
 </sources>
 <packages>
  <package name="django" line-rate="0.325" branch-rate="0" complexity="0">
   <classes>
    <class name="__init__.py" filename="django/__init__.py" complexity="0" line-rate="1" branch-rate="0">
     <methods/>
     <lines>
      <line number="1" hits="1"/>
      ...
     </lines>
    </class>
    <class name="__main__.py" filename="django/__main__.py" complexity="0" line-rate="0.6667" branch-rate="0">
     <methods/>
     <lines>
      <line number="7" hits="1"/>
      ...
     </lines>
    </class>
    <class name="shortcuts.py" filename="django/shortcuts.py" complexity="0" line-rate="0.1846" branch-rate="0">
     <methods/>
     <lines>
      <line number="7" hits="1"/>
      ...
     </lines>
    </class>
   </classes>
  </package>
 </packages>
</coverage>
```

This is a simplified view of the coverage file that will be generated in reality. To properly understand what is being reported, you need to understand the structure and the meaning of the elements and attributes within the XML. Here's an explanation of the tags and what they mean.

```xml
<coverage version="7.6.1" timestamp="1727936331112" lines-valid="196017" lines-covered="64094" line-rate="0.327" branches-covered="0" branches-valid="0" branch-rate="0" complexity="0">
```

* **version:** Version of the coverage tool
* **timestamp:** When the report was generated
* **lines-valid:** Total number of lines that could be covered
* **lines-covered:** Number of lines that were actually covered
* **line-rate:** Ratio of covered lines to valid lines
* **branches-covered, branches-valid, branch-rate:** Similar metrics for branches (not used in this example)
* **complexity:** Complexity metric (not used in this example)

```xml
<sources>
  <source>/path/to/django</source>
</sources>
```

Lists the source directories. There may be multiple sources if you are running tests for multiple applications or libraries.

```xml
<packages>
  <package name="django" line-rate="0.325" branch-rate="0" complexity="0">
```

* **name:** Name of the package
* **line-rate, branch-rate, complexity:** Coverage metrics for the package

```xml
<classes>
  <class name="__init__.py" filename="django/__init__.py" complexity="0" line-rate="1" branch-rate="0">
```

* **name:** Name of the class or file being tested
* **filename:** Path to the file
* **complexity, line-rate, branch-rate:** Coverage metrics for the class/file

```xml
<methods/>
```

Placeholder for method-level coverage (empty in this example).

```xml
<lines>
  <line number="1" hits="1"/>
  ...
</lines>
```

* Each `<line>` element represents a line of code
* **number:** Line number in the source file
* **hits:** Number of times the line was executed

## Coverage Gutters Extension for VSCode

The Coverage Gutters extension for VSCode allows you to view code coverage directly within your editor. Follow these steps to set it up and use it.

### Install the Coverage Gutters Extension

Open VSCode.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
Search for Coverage Gutters and click Install.
![Install Coverage Gutters Extension View](.//images/Django/coverage-gutters-extension-install-view.png)

### Point Coverage Gutters to coverage files

Ensure you have generated a coverage report in a supported format (e.g., `coverage.xml` or `lcov.info`).
If you haven't already, run the following commands from the root of the Django repo to run the tests and generate the `XML` coverage report:

```bash
coverage run ./tests/runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite
coverage xml
```

Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
Type `Coverage Gutters: Display Coverage` and select it.

![VSCode command pallette with 'Coverage Gutters: Display Coverage' entered](.//images/Django/coverage-gutters-extension-display.png)

If the extension was unable to find your coverage file, and you have generated one, you will be prompted to select the file path at this step.

Usually, the extension will automatically find your coverage report and use it to display the metric when you open any file.

### View Coverage in Files

Open any source file in your project.
You will see colored gutters indicating the coverage:

* Green: Covered lines
* Red: Uncovered line

![VSCode window with Coverage Gutters watch enabled for file](./images/Django/coverage-gutters-extension-view-before.png)  

Once you have added coverage of a line in your tests, you will see the gutter update to green and the percentage coverage of the file increase to reflect the coverage of the new test.

Everything up to this point is most likely sufficient for a lot of developers or small teams, however as projects grow, complexity increases and there are more hands at work on the codebase, this solution may not be sufficient any more.

Imagine you are working on a large project with multiple contributors and stakeholders. You want to ensure that your codebase maintains high test coverage, but relying solely on the Coverage Gutters extension has some limitations:

* **Limited to Local Environment:** The Coverage Gutters extension only shows coverage in your local VSCode environment. Other team members won't see the same coverage information unless they also generate and load the coverage report.
* **No Historical Data:** The extension does not provide historical coverage data or trends over time.
* **No Integration with CI/CD:** The extension does not integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to enforce coverage thresholds on pull requests.

## Codecov

Codecov is a tool for visualizing code coverage to help developers and managers to track the effectiveness of their tests. By integrating it into your CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure continuous monitoring of code coverage metrics across branches and pull requests, encouraging higher code quality.

* **Centralized Coverage Reports:**
Uploads coverage reports to a centralized dashboard accessible by all team members. This ensures everyone has access to the same coverage information without generating reports locally.

* **Historical Data and Trends:**
Codecov provides historical data and visualizations of coverage trends over time. This helps you track improvements or regression in coverage across different commits and branches.

* **CI/CD Integration:**
It integrates with your CI/CD pipeline, automatically uploading coverage reports generated during your builds. It enforces coverage thresholds on pull requests, ensuring that new code does not decrease overall coverage.
For example, you can configure Codecov to fail a pull request if the coverage drops below a certain percentage, ensuring that all new code is adequately tested.

* **Reports and Annotations:**
Codecov provides detailed coverage reports and annotations directly on GitHub pull requests. This allows reviewers to see which lines of code are covered or uncovered without leaving the GitHub interface.

This section will walk you through setting up Codecov to track your test coverage and generate reports using a GitHub Actions pipeline. It will make use of the same [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework [repository](https://github.com/django/django) as above and is purely an addition to the project.

Adjusting these steps will allow you to add Codecov integration with any other application in a GitHub repository that already generates code coverage reports.

![Codecov coverage report for django repo](.//images/Django/codecov-django-coverage.png)

---

### Set Up Codecov

[Sign up](https://about.codecov.io/codecov-free-trial/) for Codecov with your GitHub account and follow the prompts which will get you signed in and connected to your github repository which will walk you through creating an account and installing the GitHub application. Once you have reached that point, you can continue with this guide.

**Find Your Codecov Upload Token:**
Once youâ€™ve created an account and connected your repository, obtain the upload token for your project. Youâ€™ll need this token to securely upload coverage reports to Codecov.

![Codecov Upload Token](./images/Django/codecov-repo-secret.png)

In order to test your setup or inspect your data in Codecov, use the Codecov [CLI](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-uploader) to upload the coverage report you generated earlier.

### Codecov CLI

Using the Codecov CLI, you can manually upload coverage reports to the service for visualization and analysis.

First, install the Codecov CLI in the `django` virtual environment created earlier:

```bash
pip install codecov-cli
```

Upload the report to Codecov using the CLI, replace `<token>` with the upload token found on your Codecov dashboard:

```bash
codecovcli upload-process -t <token> -F service -f coverage.xml
```

This will send the report to Codecov, where it can be visualized and analyzed on the platformâ€™s dashboard.

### GitHub Actions

To automate coverage tracking, youâ€™ll want to run Codecov as part of your CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.

#### Save the token in your GitHub repository settings

You will need the upload token from Codecov that was displayed on the Codecov landing page. If you need to reference it again, you can find it by navigating to the **Configuration** tab and selecting the **General** menu item.

![Codecov Upload Token](./images/Django/codecov-django-configuration-token.png)

Navigate to the **Settings** tab of your repository, select the **Secrets and variables** menu option and add the Codecov token as a **New repository secret**.

![Codecov Upload Token](./images/Django/repo-secret-added.png)

#### Edit Workflow

Open the existing workflow configuration file at `.github/workflows/tests.yml` in your Django repository. This file will define the steps for running tests, generating coverage reports, and uploading those reports to Codecov:

```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  pull_request:
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**'

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  windows:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version:
          - '3.12'
    name: Windows, SQLite, Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          cache: 'pip'
          cache-dependency-path: 'tests/requirements/py3.txt'
      - name: Install and upgrade packaging tools
        run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
      - run: python -m pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt -e .
      - name: Run tests
        run: python tests/runtests.py -v2

  javascript-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: JavaScript tests
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
          cache-dependency-path: '**/package.json'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

You'll need to make some small changes additions to generate and upload the coverage report.

Replace the the `Install and upgrade packaging tools` section with:

```yaml
- name: Install and upgrade packaging tools
  run: python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
- run: python -m pip install -r tests/requirements/py3.txt -e .
- run: python -m pip install coverage
```

Only one new command was added: `python -m pip install coverage`.

Then edit the `Run Tests` step with:

```yaml
 
```

Upload the coverage report using Codecovâ€™s GitHub Action by adding a new step to your GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Combine coverage reports
  run: coverage xml
- name: Upload results to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

This step makes use of the Codecov GitHub application to collect the coverage report and upload it to Codecov so that it can be processed into visualizations and reports.

After these edits, the workflow will now additionally install the `coverage` package, run the tests using `coverage`, combine any result files, generate an `XML` file, and upload that file to Codecov, ready for inspection.

### Upload Coverage Report

#### Commit and Push Your Changes

After creating the workflow file, commit and push your changes to trigger the workflow:

 ```bash
 git add .
 git commit -m "Add Codecov integration"
 git push origin main
 ```

#### Monitor GitHub Actions Pipeline

Open the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the status of the CI pipeline. Make sure that all steps, especially the Codecov upload, are completed successfully.

![completed job runs](./images/Django/django-repo-actions-run.png)

#### Verify Coverage Upload

After the pipeline completes, check the Codecov dashboard to verify that the coverage report was uploaded correctly.

---

## Additional Codecov Configuration

Add a Codecov YAML configuration file to configure the views of your project in Codecov.

* Create a file named `codecov.yml` in the root directory of the Django project
* Add the necessary configuration settings to the `codecov.yml` file. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
coverage:
  status:
    project:
      default:
        target: 30%
    patch:
      default:
        target: 30%

comment:
  layout: "reach, diff, flags, files"
```

This configuration sets a target coverage of 30% for both the entire project and individual patches and specifies the layout for comments on pull requests.

To ensure that there are no errors in the `codecov.yml` file, it is best to make use of the Codecov VSCode [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codecov.codecov) to assist with validation.

Install the extension and use the icon at the top of the page to run the validation. A notice will appear with the results.

![Codecov extension button to validate yaml file](./images/Django/codecov-extension-validate.png)

![Codecov extension validate notice](./images/Django/codecov-extension-validate-notice.png)

You can now commit these changes and view the changes in your Codecov dashboard after the pipelines have been completed.

To see some more advanced usage of the Codecov YAML, see the [documentation](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-yaml).

After you have made a commit or opened a pull request, you will be able to view the report when you navigate to the **Commits** tab in Codecov.

![Codecov commit report](./images/Django/codecov-commit-report.png)
