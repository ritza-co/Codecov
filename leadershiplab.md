The main focus that the speaker is trying to drive home is that the reader is the most important thing to consider when writing.

It's important to not use the writing that you use to help you think, no one knows or cares about what is in your head. The main job of a writer is to change the mind of the reader.

The biggest problem that turns readers away is when the writing slows them down, causing them to re-read which will generally lead to the reader getting angry and stopping, meaning the writer has failed at their job.
A reader is only going to be reading that that bring them value, it is the job of the writer to provide that value by understanding WHO the target of the writing is.

A good piece of writing is all of the following: clear, organized, persuasive and _VALUABLE_

Challenging the status quo (Or what is considered right or normal) within the rules set by a community is the best way to insert yourself as an expert within said community.
The reader is then determined by who is going to challenge what has been written.

Being original is overrated, people care about the value the writing brings to them, not how original it is.

There is a whole section on visualizing how knowledge works, the basics of which is that we tend to think that all knowledge is based on what came before, but that is not really the case. Knowledge enters and exits, along with people for who that knowledge is valuable.

All communities have their own code for how they speak. Learn and use this code when you are writing for member of that community.

Specific words are used to indicate that the writer is aware of existing knowledge, they are: widely, accepted, and reported.

Flow or translation word help to make your writing flow much better: and, but, because, unless, nonetheless, however, although, etc.

Words such as anomaly, inconsistent, but, however, although are used to introduce a sense of tension in writing. This will help keeping a reader engages and is closely related to the 'challenge of ideas'.

Most of what I was able to take away is the importance of understanding the readers/communities you are actually writing for. That information is what a writer should be using to inform the language they use and what value they can bring to the table. This seems like a really tough task. A tip about this is that if you don't know the audience, you should be enhancing the problem.
